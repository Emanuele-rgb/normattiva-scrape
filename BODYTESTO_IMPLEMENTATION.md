# üéØ BODYTESTO EXTRACTION & CORRELATED ARTICLES - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully enhanced the NORME-NET versioning system to properly extract text from the `bodyTesto` div class and capture correlated articles from links within it, exactly as requested.

## ‚úÖ Problems Solved

### 1. Text Extraction from bodyTesto Div

**Problem**: The scraper was not specifically looking for the `bodyTesto` div class for article content.

**Solution**:

- Enhanced `extract_original_version()` to specifically search for `div[contains(@class, "bodyTesto")]`
- Updated `extract_aggiornamenti_versions()` to find bodyTesto in aggiornamento sections
- Implemented fallback logic to search parent containers for bodyTesto when not immediately found

### 2. Empty "articoli_correlati" Field

**Problem**: The database field "articoli_correlati" was always empty.

**Solution**:

- Added `extract_correlated_articles()` function that finds all links within bodyTesto div
- Implemented article reference detection using multiple patterns (art., articolo, comma, etc.)
- Extracts both text content and href URLs for complete reference tracking
- Stores correlated articles as JSON array in the database

## üîß Enhanced Functions

### Text Processing

```python
def clean_article_text(text):
    """Clean article text by removing extra whitespace and normalizing"""
    # Removes multiple whitespaces, normalizes line breaks
    # Cleans up legal document artifacts
```

### Correlation Extraction

```python
def extract_correlated_articles(body_element):
    """Extract correlated articles from links within the bodyTesto div"""
    # Finds all <a> tags within bodyTesto
    # Matches patterns: art. X, articolo X, comma X, lettera X
    # Returns structured data with text, href, article_number, type
```

### Enhanced Version Extraction

- **Original Version**: Now extracts from bodyTesto div with correlated articles
- **Aggiornamenti**: Searches for bodyTesto in aggiornamento sections
- **Data Structure**: Includes `testo_pulito` and `articoli_correlati` fields

## üìä Test Results

### bodyTesto Extraction Test

```
‚úÖ bodyTesto content extracted and stored in testo_completo
‚úÖ Cleaned text stored in testo_pulito
‚úÖ Correlated articles extracted from links and stored as JSON
‚úÖ Article correlation network can be analyzed
‚úÖ Cross-references between articles tracked
```

### Sample Data Structure

```json
{
  "text": "art. 3",
  "href": "/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:decreto.legge:2020-03-17;18~art3",
  "article_number": "3",
  "type": "article_reference"
}
```

### Correlation Network Analysis

The system now enables:

- Finding all articles that reference a specific article
- Building citation networks between articles
- Analyzing most-referenced articles
- Cross-reference validation

## üîç Database Fields Updated

### `articoli` table:

- **`testo_completo`**: Now populated from bodyTesto div content
- **`articoli_correlati`**: JSON array of correlated article references

### `articoli_versioni` table:

- **`testo_versione`**: From bodyTesto div (complete text)
- **`testo_pulito`**: Cleaned version without artifacts
- **Correlation tracking**: Each version can have its own correlations

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Query Correlated Articles

```sql
-- Find articles referencing Art. 3
SELECT numero_articolo, titolo
FROM articoli
WHERE articoli_correlati LIKE '%"article_number": "3"%';

-- Get correlation statistics
SELECT
  json_extract(value, '$.article_number') as referenced_article,
  COUNT(*) as reference_count
FROM articoli, json_each(articoli.articoli_correlati)
GROUP BY referenced_article
ORDER BY reference_count DESC;
```

### Scraper Usage

```python
# The enhanced scraper automatically:
# 1. Finds bodyTesto div
# 2. Extracts complete text content
# 3. Identifies all article links within bodyTesto
# 4. Stores both original and cleaned text
# 5. Creates correlation network data

python scraper_with_versioning.py "urn:nir:stato:legge:2020-03-17;18"
```
